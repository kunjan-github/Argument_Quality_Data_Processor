README for the Dagstuhl-15512 ArgQuality Corpus
===================================================

This repository contains the Dagstuhl-15512 ArgQuality Corpus.

For easy access to the dataset, I have hosted it separately on Kaggle. You can find the dataset along with the required files for code implementation at the following Kaggle link: [Dagstuhl-15512 ArgQuality Corpus on Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/datasets/9ca5e6ea9a4e2f5b03f0b7d6fc3635309c64ed9d3a5bafeb309853f5811a09f9)

Contents of the repository:

---------------------------------------------------
./dagstuhl-15512-argquality-corpus-annotated-xmi/
---------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the complete annotated corpus in the Apache UIMA format. Each given XMI file stores one argument together with all its annotations. The XMI files are organized in subfolders according to the issues and stances the arguments refer to.

Besides the quality annotations, the XMI files also include all metadata given for the arguments in their sources. This metadata is described for the CSV format below.

General information about the XMI format can be found at http://uima.apache.org. 

Please refer to the Kaggle repository for accessing the dataset and necessary files for code implementation.
